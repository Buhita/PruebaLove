    --By default, all the scaling and rotating is based on the top-left of the image.

    -- It sets the color for everything you draw, so not only images but rectangles, shapes and lines as well. 
    --It uses the RGB-system. Although this officially ranges from 0 to 255, with LÃ–VE it ranges from 0 to 1. 
    --So instead of (255, 200, 40) you would use (1, 0.78, 0.15). If you only know the color using the 0-255 range, 
    --you can calculate the number you want with number/255. There is also the fourth argument a which stands for alpha 
    --and decides the transparency of everything you draw. Don't forget to set the color back to white if you don't want 
    --the color for any other draw calls. You can set the background color with love.graphics.setBackgroundColor(r, g, b)

    love.graphics.setColor(1,0.78,0.15,0.5)
    -- Not passing an argument for alpha automatically sets it to 1 again.
